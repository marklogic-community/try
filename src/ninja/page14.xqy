        <p>OK, still with me?  Impressive!  I hope this has given you an understanding of
        how XPath, XQuery, and the Search API work to query MarkLogic Server.  If
        you're interested in understanding more about indexing models and internals,
        let me suggest you read:</p>

        <p><a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/inside-marklogic">Inside MarkLogic Server</a>, a long-form paper describing the MarkLogic Server
          internals: its data model, indexing system, update model, and operational
          behaviors.</p>
